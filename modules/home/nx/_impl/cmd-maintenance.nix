  # -- nx: flake/git lifecycle upkeep — up (which deploys), clean, push,
  # doctor (= format + update + deploy + clean + push). Grouped together
  # since doctor is mostly these composed (format lives in its own file —
  # cmd-format.nix — since it's also a standalone command with its own
  # docs). nuke-history lives in its own file (cmd-nuke-history.nix) —
  # unlike these, it rewrites history and isn't something you run routinely.
  #
  # doctor deliberately does NOT call `nx up`: up only deploys when
  # `nix flake update` actually changed flake.lock, so a doctor run whose
  # only pending changes are elsewhere (e.g. apps.nix) would commit and
  # push them but never build/switch. doctor instead updates inputs itself
  # and always deploys exactly once afterward — deploy's own `git add -A`
  # picks up both the flake.lock bump and any other pending changes in one
  # commit/build/switch.

    # unchanged, in which case there's nothing new to build and deploy is
